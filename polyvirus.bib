	abstract = {SUMMARY: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

	abstract = {Current knowledge of RNA virus biodiversity is both biased and fragmentary, reflecting a focus on culturable or disease-causing agents. Here we profile the transcriptomes of over 220 invertebrate species sampled across nine animal phyla and report the discovery of 1,445 RNA viruses, including some that are sufficiently divergent to comprise new families. The identified viruses fill major gaps in the RNA virus phylogeny and reveal an evolutionary history that is characterized by both host switching and co-divergence. The invertebrate virome also reveals remarkable genomic flexibility that includes frequent recombination, lateral gene transfer among viruses and hosts, gene gain and loss, and complex genomic rearrangements. Together, these data present a view of the RNA virosphere that is more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than that depicted in current classification schemes and provide a more solid foundation for studies in virus ecology and evolution.},

@article{shi_17,
	abstract = {Mosquitoes harbor a high diversity of RNA viruses, including many that impact human health. Despite a growing effort to describe the extent and nature of the mosquito virome, little is known about how these viruses persist, spread, and interact with both their hosts and other microbes. To address this issue we performed a metatranscriptomics analysis of 12 Western Australian mosquito populations structured by species and geographic location. Our results identified the complete genomes of 24 species of RNA viruses from a diverse range of viral families and orders, among which 19 are newly described. Comparisons of viromes revealed a striking difference between the two mosquito genera, with viromes of mosquitoes of the Aedes genus exhibiting substantially less diversity and lower abundances than those of mosquitoes of the Culex genus, within which the viral abundance reached 16.87\% of the total non-rRNA. In addition, there was little overlap in viral diversity between the two genera, although the viromes were very similar among the three Culex species studied, suggesting that the host taxon plays a major role in structuring virus diversity. In contrast, we found no evidence that geographic location played a major role in shaping RNA virus diversity, and several viruses discovered here exhibited high similarity (95 to 98\% nucleotide identity) to those from Indonesia and China. Finally, using abundance-level and phylogenetic relationships, we were able to distinguish potential mosquito viruses from those present in coinfecting bacteria, fungi, and protists. In sum, our metatranscriptomics approach provides important insights into the ecology of mosquito RNA viruses.IMPORTANCE Studies of virus ecology have generally focused on individual viral species. However, recent advances in bulk RNA sequencing make it possible to utilize metatranscriptomic approaches to reveal both complete virus diversity and the relative abundance of these viruses. We used such a metatranscriptomic approach to determine key aspects of the ecology of mosquito viruses in Western Australia. Our results show that RNA viruses are some of the most important components of the mosquito transcriptome, and we identified 19 new virus species from a diverse set of virus families. A key result was that host genetic background plays a more important role in shaping virus diversity than sampling location, with Culex species harboring more viruses at higher abundance than those from Aedes mosquitoes.},

@article{mie_14,
	abstract = {The ongoing conflict between viruses and their hosts can drive the co-evolution between host immune genes and viral suppressors of immunity. It has been suggested that an evolutionary `arms race' may occur between rapidly evolving components of the antiviral RNAi pathway of Drosophila and viral genes that antagonize it. We have recently shown that viral protein 1 (VP1) of Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Here we show that viral AGO2 antagonists of divergent Nora-like viruses can have host specific activities. We have identified novel Nora-like viruses in wild-caught populations of D. immigrans (DimmNV) and D. subobscura (DsubNV) that are 36\% and 26\% divergent from DmelNV at the amino acid level. We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D. melanogaster S2 cells, whereas DmelNV VP1 potently suppresses RNAi in this host species. Moreover, we show that the RNAi suppressor activity of DimmNV VP1 is restricted to its natural host species, D. immigrans. Specifically, we find that DimmNV VP1 interacts with D. immigrans AGO2, but not with D. melanogaster AGO2, and that it suppresses slicer activity in embryo lysates from D. immigrans, but not in lysates from D. melanogaster. This species-specific interaction is reflected in the ability of DimmNV VP1 to enhance RNA production by a recombinant Sindbis virus in a host-specific manner. Our results emphasize the importance of analyzing viral RNAi suppressor activity in the relevant host species. We suggest that rapid co-evolution between RNA viruses and their hosts may result in host species-specific activities of RNAi suppressor proteins, and therefore that viral RNAi suppressors could be host-specificity factors.},

	abstract = { Viruses are the most abundant and the most diverse life form. In this meta-analysis we estimate that there are 4.80×1031 phages on Earth. Further, 97\% of viruses are in soil and sediment---two underinvestigated biomes that combined account for only ∼2.5\% of publicly available viral metagenomes. The majority of the most abundant viral sequences from all biomes are novel. Our analysis drawing on all publicly available viral metagenomes observed a mere 257,698 viral genotypes on Earth---an unrealistically low number---which attests to the current paucity of viral metagenomic data. Further advances in viral ecology and diversity call for a shift of attention to previously ignored major biomes and careful application of verified methods for viral metagenomic analysis. },

	abstract = {The genomes of RNA viruses are characterized by their
	  extremely small size and extremely high mutation rates (typically 10 kb and
	      10−4/base/replication cycle, respectively), traits that are thought to be
	    causally linked. One aspect of their small size is the genome compression
	    caused by the use of overlapping genes (where some nucleotides code for two
		genes). Using a comparative analysis of all known RNA viral species, we show
	    that viruses with larger genomes tend to have less gene overlap. We provide a
	    numerical model to show how a high mutation rate could lead to gene overlap,
	  and we discuss the factors that might explain the observed relationship between
	    gene overlap and genome size. We also propose a model for the evolution of gene
	    overlap based on the co-opting of previously unused ORFs, which gives rise to
	    two types of overlap: (1) the creation of novel genes inside older genes,
	  predominantly via +1 frameshifts, and (2) the incremental increase in overlap
	    between originally contiguous genes, with no frameshift preference. Both types
	    of overlap are viewed as the creation of genomic novelty under pressure for
	    genome compression. Simulations based on our model generate the empirical size
	    distributions of overlaps and explain the observed frameshift preferences. We
	    suggest that RNA viruses are a good model system for the investigation of
	    general evolutionary relationship between genome attributes such as mutational
	    robustness, mutation rate, and size.},

	  the antisense strands of the genes coding for the glycolytic enzymes
	    phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase and alcohol
	    dehydrogenase I. The open reading frames on both strands are in codon register.
	    It has been suggested that proteins coded in codon register by complementary
	    DNA strands can bind to each other. Consequently, it was interesting to
	    investigate whether the open reading frames in the antisense strands of
	    glycolytic enzyme genes are functional. We used oligonucleotide-directed
	    mutagenesis of the PGI1 phosphoglucose isomerase gene to introduce pairs of
	    closely spaced base substitutions that resulted in stop codons in one strand
	    and only silent replacements in the other. Introduction of the two stop codons
	    into the PGI1 sense strand caused the same physiological defects as already
	    observed for pgil deletion mutants. No detectable effects were caused by the
	    two stop codons in the antisense strand. A deletion that removed a section from
	    -31 bp to +109 bp of the PGI1 gene but left 83 bases of the 3' region beyond
	    the antisense open reading frame had the same phenotype as a deletion removing
	    both reading frames. A similar pair of deletions of the PYK1 gene and its
	    antisense reading frame showed identical defects. Our own Northern experiments
	    and those reported by other authors using double-stranded probes detected only
	    one transcript for each gene. These observations indicate that the antisense
	    reading frames are not functional. On the other hand, evidence is provided to
	    show that the rather long reading frames in the antisense strands of these
	    glycolytic enzyme genes could arise from the strongly selective codon usage in
	    highly expressed yeast genes, which reduces the frequency of stop codons in the
	    antisense strand.},

A deep-branching trypanosomatid viral lineage showing strong affinities to bunyaviruses was termed ``Leishbunyavirus'' (LBV) and judged sufficiently distinct to warrant assignment within a proposed family termed ``Leishbunyaviridae.'' Numerous relatives of trypanosomatid viruses were found in insect metatranscriptomic surveys, which likely arise from trypanosomatid microbiota. Despite extensive sampling we found no relatives of the totivirus Leishmaniavirus (LRV1/2), implying that it was acquired at about the same time the Leishmania became able to parasitize vertebrates. As viruses were found in over a quarter of isolates tested, many more are likely to be found in the {\textgreater}600 unsurveyed trypanosomatid species. Viral loss was occasionally observed in culture, providing potentially isogenic virus-free lines enabling studies probing the biological role of trypanosomatid viruses. These data shed important insights on the emergence of viruses within an important trypanosomatid clade relevant to human disease.},

@article{Lebre2017,
	abstract = {Overlapping genes exist in all domains of life and are much
	  more abundant than expected upon their first discovery in the late 1970s.
	    Assuming that the reference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can
	    be encoded in two reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and
	    in three reading frames in the opposite strand, denoted by −0, −1, and −2. This
	    motivated numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic
	    code on the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our
	    focus in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in
	    terms of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear
	    constraints bind the amino-acid composition of two proteins encoded by
	    overlapping genes. Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are
	    considered, and not just single amino acids. For example, in double-coding
	    sequences with an overlapping reading frame −2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr
		or Y) in the overlapping frame overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0
	    (and reciprocally), whereas specific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus
	    distinguish between null constraints (YY = 0 in frame −2) and non-null
	    constraints (Y in frame +0 ⇔ Y in frame −2). Our equivalence-based constraints
	    are symmetrical and thus enable the characterization of the joint composition
	    of overlapping proteins. We describe several formal frameworks and a graph
	    algorithm to characterize and compute these constraints. As expected, the
	    degrees of freedom left by these constraints vary drastically among the
	    different overlapping frames. Interestingly, the biological meaning of
	    constraints induced on two overlapping proteins (hydropathy, forbidden
		di-peptides, expected overlap length {\ldots}) is also specific to the reading frame.
	    We study the combinatorics of these constraints for overlapping polypeptides of
	    length n, pointing out that, (i) except for frame −2, non-null constraints are
	    deduced from the amino-acid (length = 1) constraints and (ii) null constraints
	    are deduced from the di-peptide (length = 2) constraints. These results yield
	    support for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes,
	  and for developing novel overlapping gene detection methods.},

@article{Rancurel2009,
	abstract = {It is widely assumed that new proteins are created by
	  duplication, fusion, or fission of existing coding sequences. Another mechanism
	    of protein birth is provided by overlapping genes. They are created de novo by
	    mutations within a coding sequence that lead to the expression of a novel
	    protein in another reading frame, a process called ``overprinting.'' To
	    investigate this mechanism, we have analyzed the sequences of the protein
	    products of manually curated overlapping genes from 43 genera of unspliced RNA
	    viruses infecting eukaryotes. Overlapping proteins have a sequence composition
	    globally biased toward disorder-promoting amino acids and are predicted to
	    contain significantly more structural disorder than nonoverlapping proteins. By
	    analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of overlapping proteins, we were able
	    to confirm that 17 of these had been created de novo and to study them
	    individually. Most proteins created de novo are orphans (i.e., restricted to
	    one species or genus). Almost all are accessory proteins that play a role in
	    viral pathogenicity or spread, rather than proteins central to viral
	    replication or structure. Most proteins created de novo are predicted to be
	    fully disordered and have a highly unusual sequence composition. This suggests
	    that some viral overlapping reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins with
	    highly biased composition, often discarded as noncoding, might in fact encode
	    proteins. Some proteins created de novo are predicted to be ordered, however,
	    and whenever a three-dimensional structure of such a protein has been solved,
	    it corresponds to a fold previously unobserved, suggesting that the study of
	    these proteins could enhance our knowledge of protein space.},
