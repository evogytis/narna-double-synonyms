@article{lartillot+04,
	abstract = {Most current models of sequence evolution assume that all sites of a protein evolve under the same substitution process, characterized by a 20 × 20 substitution matrix. Here, we propose to relax this assumption by developing a Bayesian mixture model that allows the amino-acid replacement pattern at different sites of a protein alignment to be described by distinct substitution processes. Our model, named CAT, assumes the existence of distinct processes (or classes) differing by their equilibrium frequencies over the 20 residues. Through the use of a Dirichlet process prior, the total number of classes and their respective amino-acid profiles, as well as the affiliations of each site to a given class, are all free variables of the model. In this way, the CAT model is able to adapt to the complexity actually present in the data, and it yields an estimate of the substitutional heterogeneity through the posterior mean number of classes. We show that a significant level of heterogeneity is present in the substitution patterns of proteins, and that the standard one-matrix model fails to account for this heterogeneity. By evaluating the Bayes factor, we demonstrate that the standard model is outperformed by CAT on all of the data sets which we analyzed. Altogether, these results suggest that the complexity of the pattern of substitution of real sequences is better captured by the CAT model, offering the possibility of studying its impact on phylogenetic reconstruction and its connections with structure-function determinants.},

	abstract = {Methods for alignment of protein sequences typically measure similarity by using a substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one amino acid with another. The most widely used matrices are based on the Dayhoff model of evolutionary rates. Using a different approach, we have derived substitution matrices from about 2000 blocks of aligned sequence segments characterizing more than 500 groups of related proteins. This led to marked improvements in alignments and in searches using queries from each of the groups.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3--4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.https://github.com/lh3/minimap2Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{waldron+18,
	abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi)-related pathways target viruses and transposable element (TE) transcripts in plants, fungi, and ecdysozoans (nematodes and arthropods), giving protection against infection and transmission. In each case, this produces abundant TE and virus-derived 20-30nt small RNAs, which provide a characteristic signature of RNAi-mediated defence. The broad phylogenetic distribution of the Argonaute and Dicer-family genes that mediate these pathways suggests that defensive RNAi is ancient, and probably shared by most animal (metazoan) phyla. Indeed, while vertebrates had been thought an exception, it has recently been argued that mammals also possess an antiviral RNAi pathway, although its immunological relevance is currently uncertain and the viral small RNAs (viRNAs) are not easily detectable. Here we use a metagenomic approach to test for the presence of viRNAs in five species from divergent animal phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, and Annelida), and in a brown alga---which represents an independent origin of multicellularity from plants, fungi, and animals. We use metagenomic RNA sequencing to identify around 80 virus-like contigs in these lineages, and small RNA sequencing to identify viRNAs derived from those viruses. We identified 21U small RNAs derived from an RNA virus in the brown alga, reminiscent of plant and fungal viRNAs, despite the deep divergence between these lineages. However, contrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify canonical (i.e. Drosophila- or nematode-like) viRNAs in any of the animals, despite the widespread presence of abundant micro-RNAs, and somatic transposon-derived piwi-interacting RNAs. We did identify a distinctive group of small RNAs derived from RNA viruses in the mollusc. However, unlike ecdysozoan viRNAs, these had a piRNA-like length distribution but lacked key signatures of piRNA biogenesis. We also identified primary piRNAs derived from putatively endogenous copies of DNA viruses in the cnidarian and the echinoderm, and an endogenous RNA virus in the mollusc. The absence of canonical virus-derived small RNAs from our samples may suggest that the majority of animal phyla lack an antiviral RNAi response. Alternatively, these phyla could possess an antiviral RNAi response resembling that reported for vertebrates, with cryptic viRNAs not detectable through simple metagenomic sequencing of wild-type individuals. In either case, our findings show that the antiviral RNAi responses of arthropods and nematodes, which are highly divergent from each other and from that of plants and fungi, are also highly diverged from the most likely ancestral metazoan state.},

@article{rodriguez-cousino+98,
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} strains carry single-stranded RNAs called 20 S RNA and 23 S RNA. These RNAs and their double-stranded counterparts, W and T dsRNAs, have been cloned and sequenced. A few nucleotides at both ends, however, remained unknown. These RNAs do not encode coat proteins but their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that share a high degree of conservation to each other. The polymerases are also similar to the replicases of RNA coliphages, such as Qβ. Here we have determined the nucleotide sequences of W and T dsRNAs at both ends using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA clones. We confirmed the terminal sequences by primer-extension and RNase protection experiments. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that W and T dsRNAs and their single-stranded RNA counterparts (i) are linear molecules, (ii) have identical nucleotide sequences at their ends, and (iii) have no poly(A) tails at their 3′ ends. Both 20 S and 23 S RNAs have GGGGC at the 5′ ends and the complementary 5-nucleotides sequence, GCCCC-OH, at their 3′ ends. S1 and V1 secondary structure-mapping of the 3′ ends of 20 S and 23 S RNAs shows the presence of a stem-loop structure that partially overlaps with the conserved 3′ end sequence. Nucleotide sequences and stem-loop structures similar to those described here have been found at the 3′ ends of RNA coliphages. These data, together with the similarity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases encoded among these RNAs and RNA coliphages, suggest that 20 S and 23 S RNAs are plus-strand single-stranded virus-like RNA replicons in yeast.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{mizutani+18,
	abstract = {Hypovirulence of phytopathogenic fungi are often conferred by mycovirus(es) infections and for this reason many mycoviruses have been characterized, contributing to a better understanding of virus diversity. In this study, three strains of Fusarium head blight fungus (Fusarium boothii) were isolated from Ethiopian wheats as dsRNA-carrying strains: hypovirulent Ep-BL13 ({\textgreater}10, 3 and 2.5 kbp dsRNAs), and virulent Ep-BL14 and Ep-N28 (3 kbp dsRNA each) strains. The 3 kbp-dsRNAs shared 98\% nucleotide identity and have single ORFs encoding a replicase when applied to mitochondrial codon usage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed these were strains of a new species termed Fusarium boothii mitovirus 1 in the genus Mitovirus. The largest and smallest dsRNAs in Ep-BL13 appeared to possess single ORFs and the smaller was originated from the larger by removal of its most middle part. The large dsRNA encoded a replicase sharing the highest amino acid identity (35\%) with that of Botrytis virus F, the sole member of the family Gammaflexiviridae. Given that the phylogenetic placement, large genome size, simple genomic and unusual 3′-terminal RNA structures were far different from members in the order Tymovirales, the virus termed Fusarium boothii large flexivirus 1 may form a novel genus and family under the order.},

@article{wang+20,
	abstract = {Recently, an increasing number of ourmia-like viruses have been found in fungi; however, the features of these viruses remain unknown. Here, we report a novel ourmia-like virus isolated from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This virus, named S. sclerotiorum ourmia-like virus 4 (SsOLV4), has a genome 2,982 nt in length with a G-pentamer (GGGGG) at the 5′-terminus and a C-pentamer (CCCCC) at the 3′-terminus. The SsOLV4 genome has only one large putative open reading frame (ORF) predicted with both standard codes and mitochondrial codes and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). SsOLV4 is closely phylogenetically related to Pyricularia oryzae ourmia-like virus 1, with 42\% identity between the RdRp amino acid sequences. We constructed full-length cDNA of SsOLV4 and synthesized RNA in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase. The synthesized RNA could transfect S. sclerotiorum protoplasts efficiently. We further found that viral RNA could infect mycelia when mixed with PEG buffer. Our study suggests that a novel genus in family Botourmiaviridae should be established for SsOLV4 and other related viruses and demonstrates that one single-stranded RNA segment encoding RdRp is sufficient for ourmia-like viruses in fungi.},

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

	abstract = {Current knowledge of RNA virus biodiversity is both biased and fragmentary, reflecting a focus on culturable or disease-causing agents. Here we profile the transcriptomes of over 220 invertebrate species sampled across nine animal phyla and report the discovery of 1,445 RNA viruses, including some that are sufficiently divergent to comprise new families. The identified viruses fill major gaps in the RNA virus phylogeny and reveal an evolutionary history that is characterized by both host switching and co-divergence. The invertebrate virome also reveals remarkable genomic flexibility that includes frequent recombination, lateral gene transfer among viruses and hosts, gene gain and loss, and complex genomic rearrangements. Together, these data present a view of the RNA virosphere that is more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than that depicted in current classification schemes and provide a more solid foundation for studies in virus ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Mosquitoes harbor a high diversity of RNA viruses, including many that impact human health. Despite a growing effort to describe the extent and nature of the mosquito virome, little is known about how these viruses persist, spread, and interact with both their hosts and other microbes. To address this issue we performed a metatranscriptomics analysis of 12 Western Australian mosquito populations structured by species and geographic location. Our results identified the complete genomes of 24 species of RNA viruses from a diverse range of viral families and orders, among which 19 are newly described. Comparisons of viromes revealed a striking difference between the two mosquito genera, with viromes of mosquitoes of the Aedes genus exhibiting substantially less diversity and lower abundances than those of mosquitoes of the Culex genus, within which the viral abundance reached 16.87\% of the total non-rRNA. In addition, there was little overlap in viral diversity between the two genera, although the viromes were very similar among the three Culex species studied, suggesting that the host taxon plays a major role in structuring virus diversity. In contrast, we found no evidence that geographic location played a major role in shaping RNA virus diversity, and several viruses discovered here exhibited high similarity (95 to 98\% nucleotide identity) to those from Indonesia and China. Finally, using abundance-level and phylogenetic relationships, we were able to distinguish potential mosquito viruses from those present in coinfecting bacteria, fungi, and protists. In sum, our metatranscriptomics approach provides important insights into the ecology of mosquito RNA viruses.IMPORTANCE Studies of virus ecology have generally focused on individual viral species. However, recent advances in bulk RNA sequencing make it possible to utilize metatranscriptomic approaches to reveal both complete virus diversity and the relative abundance of these viruses. We used such a metatranscriptomic approach to determine key aspects of the ecology of mosquito viruses in Western Australia. Our results show that RNA viruses are some of the most important components of the mosquito transcriptome, and we identified 19 new virus species from a diverse set of virus families. A key result was that host genetic background plays a more important role in shaping virus diversity than sampling location, with Culex species harboring more viruses at higher abundance than those from Aedes mosquitoes.},

@article{mie_14,
	abstract = {The ongoing conflict between viruses and their hosts can drive the co-evolution between host immune genes and viral suppressors of immunity. It has been suggested that an evolutionary `arms race' may occur between rapidly evolving components of the antiviral RNAi pathway of Drosophila and viral genes that antagonize it. We have recently shown that viral protein 1 (VP1) of Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Here we show that viral AGO2 antagonists of divergent Nora-like viruses can have host specific activities. We have identified novel Nora-like viruses in wild-caught populations of D. immigrans (DimmNV) and D. subobscura (DsubNV) that are 36\% and 26\% divergent from DmelNV at the amino acid level. We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D. melanogaster S2 cells, whereas DmelNV VP1 potently suppresses RNAi in this host species. Moreover, we show that the RNAi suppressor activity of DimmNV VP1 is restricted to its natural host species, D. immigrans. Specifically, we find that DimmNV VP1 interacts with D. immigrans AGO2, but not with D. melanogaster AGO2, and that it suppresses slicer activity in embryo lysates from D. immigrans, but not in lysates from D. melanogaster. This species-specific interaction is reflected in the ability of DimmNV VP1 to enhance RNA production by a recombinant Sindbis virus in a host-specific manner. Our results emphasize the importance of analyzing viral RNAi suppressor activity in the relevant host species. We suggest that rapid co-evolution between RNA viruses and their hosts may result in host species-specific activities of RNAi suppressor proteins, and therefore that viral RNAi suppressors could be host-specificity factors.},

Further, 97\% of viruses are in soil and sediment---two underinvestigated biomes that combined account for only ∼2.5\% of publicly available viral metagenomes. The majority of the most abundant viral sequences from all biomes are novel. Our analysis drawing on all publicly available viral metagenomes observed a mere 257,698 viral genotypes on Earth---an unrealistically low number---which attests to the current paucity of viral metagenomic data. Further advances in viral ecology and diversity call for a shift of attention to previously ignored major biomes and careful application of verified methods for viral metagenomic analysis. },

	abstract = {The genomes of RNA viruses are characterized by their
	  extremely small size and extremely high mutation rates (typically 10 kb and
	      10−4/base/replication cycle, respectively), traits that are thought to be
	    causally linked. One aspect of their small size is the genome compression
	    caused by the use of overlapping genes (where some nucleotides code for two
		genes). Using a comparative analysis of all known RNA viral species, we show
	    that viruses with larger genomes tend to have less gene overlap. We provide a
	    numerical model to show how a high mutation rate could lead to gene overlap,

	    gene overlap and genome size. We also propose a model for the evolution of gene
	    overlap based on the co-opting of previously unused ORFs, which gives rise to
	    two types of overlap: (1) the creation of novel genes inside older genes,
	  predominantly via +1 frameshifts, and (2) the incremental increase in overlap
	    between originally contiguous genes, with no frameshift preference. Both types
	    of overlap are viewed as the creation of genomic novelty under pressure for

	    phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase and alcohol
	    dehydrogenase I. The open reading frames on both strands are in codon register.
	    It has been suggested that proteins coded in codon register by complementary
	    DNA strands can bind to each other. Consequently, it was interesting to
	    investigate whether the open reading frames in the antisense strands of
	    glycolytic enzyme genes are functional. We used oligonucleotide-directed
	    mutagenesis of the PGI1 phosphoglucose isomerase gene to introduce pairs of
	    closely spaced base substitutions that resulted in stop codons in one strand
	    and only silent replacements in the other. Introduction of the two stop codons
	    into the PGI1 sense strand caused the same physiological defects as already
	    observed for pgil deletion mutants. No detectable effects were caused by the
	    two stop codons in the antisense strand. A deletion that removed a section from
	    -31 bp to +109 bp of the PGI1 gene but left 83 bases of the 3' region beyond
	    the antisense open reading frame had the same phenotype as a deletion removing
	    both reading frames. A similar pair of deletions of the PYK1 gene and its
	    antisense reading frame showed identical defects. Our own Northern experiments
	    and those reported by other authors using double-stranded probes detected only
	    one transcript for each gene. These observations indicate that the antisense
	    reading frames are not functional. On the other hand, evidence is provided to
	    show that the rather long reading frames in the antisense strands of these
	    glycolytic enzyme genes could arise from the strongly selective codon usage in
	    highly expressed yeast genes, which reduces the frequency of stop codons in the
	    antisense strand.},

We surveyed RNA viruses in 52 cultured monoxenous relatives of the human parasite Leishmania (Crithidia and Leptomonas), as well as plant-infecting Phytomonas. Leptomonas pyrrhocoris was a hotbed for viral discovery, carrying a virus (Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1) with a highly divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase missed by conventional BLAST searches, an emergent clade of tombus-like viruses, and an example of viral endogenization. A deep-branching clade of trypanosomatid narnaviruses was found, notable as Leptomonas seymouri bearing Narna-like virus 1 (LepseyNLV1) have been reported in cultures recovered from patients with visceral leishmaniasis. A deep-branching trypanosomatid viral lineage showing strong affinities to bunyaviruses was termed ``Leishbunyavirus'' (LBV) and judged sufficiently distinct to warrant assignment within a proposed family termed ``Leishbunyaviridae.'' Numerous relatives of trypanosomatid viruses were found in insect metatranscriptomic surveys, which likely arise from trypanosomatid microbiota. Despite extensive sampling we found no relatives of the totivirus Leishmaniavirus (LRV1/2), implying that it was acquired at about the same time the Leishmania became able to parasitize vertebrates. As viruses were found in over a quarter of isolates tested, many more are likely to be found in the {\textgreater}600 unsurveyed trypanosomatid species.

@article{Lebre2017,
	abstract = {Overlapping genes exist in all domains of life and are much
	  more abundant than expected upon their first discovery in the late 1970s.
	    Assuming that the reference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can
	    be encoded in two reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and
	    in three reading frames in the opposite strand, denoted by −0, −1, and −2. This
	    motivated numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic
	    code on the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our
	    focus in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in
	    terms of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear
	    constraints bind the amino-acid composition of two proteins encoded by
	    overlapping genes. Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are
	    considered, and not just single amino acids. For example, in double-coding
	    sequences with an overlapping reading frame −2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr
		or Y) in the overlapping frame overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0
	    (and reciprocally), whereas specific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus
	    distinguish between null constraints (YY = 0 in frame −2) and non-null
	    constraints (Y in frame +0 ⇔ Y in frame −2). Our equivalence-based constraints
	    are symmetrical and thus enable the characterization of the joint composition
	    of overlapping proteins. We describe several formal frameworks and a graph
	    algorithm to characterize and compute these constraints. As expected, the
	    degrees of freedom left by these constraints vary drastically among the
	    different overlapping frames. Interestingly, the biological meaning of
	    constraints induced on two overlapping proteins (hydropathy, forbidden
		di-peptides, expected overlap length {\ldots}) is also specific to the reading frame.
	    We study the combinatorics of these constraints for overlapping polypeptides of
	    length n, pointing out that, (i) except for frame −2, non-null constraints are
	    deduced from the amino-acid (length = 1) constraints and (ii) null constraints
	    are deduced from the di-peptide (length = 2) constraints. These results yield
	    support for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes,
	  and for developing novel overlapping gene detection methods.},

@article{Rancurel2009,
	abstract = {It is widely assumed that new proteins are created by
	  duplication, fusion, or fission of existing coding sequences. Another mechanism
	    of protein birth is provided by overlapping genes. They are created de novo by
	    mutations within a coding sequence that lead to the expression of a novel
	    protein in another reading frame, a process called ``overprinting.'' To
	    investigate this mechanism, we have analyzed the sequences of the protein
	    products of manually curated overlapping genes from 43 genera of unspliced RNA
	    viruses infecting eukaryotes. Overlapping proteins have a sequence composition
	    globally biased toward disorder-promoting amino acids and are predicted to
	    contain significantly more structural disorder than nonoverlapping proteins. By
	    analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of overlapping proteins, we were able
	    to confirm that 17 of these had been created de novo and to study them
	    individually. Most proteins created de novo are orphans (i.e., restricted to
	    one species or genus). Almost all are accessory proteins that play a role in
	    viral pathogenicity or spread, rather than proteins central to viral
	    replication or structure. Most proteins created de novo are predicted to be
	    fully disordered and have a highly unusual sequence composition. This suggests
	    that some viral overlapping reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins with
	    highly biased composition, often discarded as noncoding, might in fact encode
	    proteins. Some proteins created de novo are predicted to be ordered, however,
	    and whenever a three-dimensional structure of such a protein has been solved,
	    it corresponds to a fold previously unobserved, suggesting that the study of
	    these proteins could enhance our knowledge of protein space.},
